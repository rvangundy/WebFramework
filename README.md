WebFramework
============

A specification for a generalized full-stack web framework.

Introduction
============

The web development ecosystem is in a state of rapid evolution. Its evolution is chaotic and decentralized, lending to the development of frameworks, libraries, tools, and best practices that are at best de facto standards. As is often the case with software, a set of solutions to common problems often appear simultaneously. Eventually some solutions fade in to obscurity, and community-driven standards drive the success of a few (or only one) solution.

The purpose of this document is to outline the minimal set of "solutions" required in a full-stack web development framework. A "solution-set" may be defined as either a monolithic multi-purpose solution or a curated set of micro-libraries that each fulfill a specific purpose.

The goal of this outline is to attempt to weed out unnecessary components and determine core functionality for a successful full-stack web architecture. To limit the scope of this document, particular focus is placed on solutions that remain in active production code--build tools, etc. shall not be included.
